## 1. Executive thesis

<img src="logo.png" alt="rowkit" width="160" height="160" /> Streaming JSONL and CSV toolkit for people who work with datasets that do not fit in a spreadsheet. Infer a schema, validate required fields, reservoir-sample rows, split train/test, and drop duplicates Ã¢â‚¬â€ all from the command line, without loading the whole file into memory.

**Why a buyer cares:** rowkit packages transferable product IP â€” source, docs, in-repo brand assets, and a diligence room under `docs/acquisition/` â€” under a clear proprietary posture so diligence can proceed without mistaking the repo for open source.

## 2. Product snapshot

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Product | rowkit |
| Repo | `theworker02/rowkit` |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Open source? | **No** â€” proprietary |
| Rightsholder | theworker02 |
| Diligence pack | `docs/acquisition/` |

### Capability highlights (from current materials)

- Which fields exist, and are they always the same type?
- How many rows are missing `id`?
- Give me 50 representative lines, not the first 50.
- Split 80/20 without shuffling the entire file in RAM.

---

## 3. Problem / opportunity

Teams evaluating rowkit typically need either (a) a commercial right to run or embed it, or (b) outright ownership of the Product IP for strategic build-out. Public GitHub visibility without a proprietary license creates false assumptions about free production use. This brief and the linked data room make the commercial path explicit.

---

## 4. What ships today

Honest maturity: treat repository contents, README claims, tests, and release tags as the source of truth. Do not assume production customers, ARR, filed patents, or SLAs unless separately evidenced in diligence.

Typical transferable surfaces:

- Source tree and build/test scripts present in-repo
- Documentation and design notes
- Acquisition / diligence markdown under `docs/acquisition/`
- Branding assets committed to the repository (if any)

## 5. Demo / evaluation path (buyer)

Minimal path (no secrets required unless README says otherwise):

```
```bash
npm install -g @magnexis/rowkit
# or
npx @magnexis/rowkit --help
```
```text
rowkit infer <file> [--format jsonl|csv] [--json] [-o schema.json]
rowkit stats <file>
rowkit sample <file> -n 50 --seed 7
rowkit validate <file> --require id,title
rowkit dedupe <file> --keys id -o unique.jsonl
rowkit split <file> --ratio 0.8 --train train.jsonl --test test.jsonl --seed 1
```
```text
field     kind     present  missing  min  max
id        integer  1200     0        1    1200
title     string   1194     6
score     number   1200     0        0    1
```
```json
{ "ok": false, "errors": ["line 12: missing required field \"title\""] }
```
```ts
import { infer, validate } from "@magnexis/rowkit";

const schema = await infer("events.jsonl", "jsonl");
const { ok } = await validate("events.jsonl", "jsonl", ["id"]);
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theworker02/rowkit.git
cd rowkit
npm install
npm test
npm run build
node dist/cli.js --help
```
```

Extended evaluation: `docs/acquisition/BUYER_EVALUATION.md`. Written NDA / evaluation grants may be required for private materials.

## 6. What a transaction typically includes

Subject to definitive schedules:

| Included (typical) | Excluded (typical) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Repo materials + asserted original IP | Seller personal accounts / unrelated repos |
| Docs + diligence room at closing | Third-party dependency source under separate licenses |
| In-repo brand marks as assigned | Secrets without rotation plan |
| Know-how captured in docs | Fabricated revenue, user, or adoption metrics |

---

## 7. Suggested deal structures

| Structure | When it fits |
|-----------|--------------|
| Non-exclusive commercial license | Deploy/run under seat or environment terms |
| Exclusive field-of-use license | Buyer wants exclusivity; seller may retain entity |
| Asset / IP assignment | Buyer wants ownership of Materials outright |
| OEM / redistribution | Separate agreement â€” not implied here |

Commercial terms (price, earnouts, escrow) are negotiated under NDA with counsel.

## 8. Buyer diligence checklist

- [ ] Confirm Rightsholder identity and authority to sell/license
- [ ] Inventory Materials (`docs/acquisition/ASSET_INVENTORY.md`)
- [ ] Review IP posture (`IP_PROVENANCE.md`) and dependencies (`DEPENDENCY_INVENTORY.md`)
- [ ] Run evaluation script (`BUYER_EVALUATION.md`)
- [ ] Review risks (`RISK_REGISTER.md`)
- [ ] Agree transfer scope (`TRANSFER_MANIFEST.md`) and handoff (`HANDOFF_CHECKLIST.md`)
- [ ] Supersede root `LICENSE` at closing via definitive agreement
